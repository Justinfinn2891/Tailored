Goals for V.02
* Be able to let the user import a type of model that they can place into the screen during game-time
* Figure out how we are going to implement an AI model to learn from possible nodes and relationships and then also place them into environment
* Try to get 3 models for each considerable object (chair, desk, table, couch, bed) to help build a solid inventory system
